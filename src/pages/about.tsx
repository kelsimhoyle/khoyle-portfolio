                        <p>I'm an educator turned web developer. As a self-proclaimed lifelong learner, the switch into tech was seemless because there is <i>always</i> something to learn.</p>
                        <p>I completed the Full-Stack Web Development Certificate at the University of Denver in 2019, where I honed my skill of learning new technology quickly and effectively.</p>
                        <p>My favorite technologies include: JavaScript, Typescript, Node, React, Gatsby, and GraphQL. But I am always finding a new favorite. ðŸ˜‰ </p>
                        <p>In my freetime I enjoy to run (at a very slow pace), read, spend time with my family, and hike!</p>
